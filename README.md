# SoyuzRP
A free and open source roleplay suite for Garry's Mod.

## Project Description

Garry's Mod has many, many, roleplay servers... but none of them, in my 
experience, are any good. They are focused around the wrong things, and the 
players haven't learned good habits or what roleplaying is actually about. 

SoyuzRP is hoping to change the attitudes towards roleplay in Garry's Mod by 
providing a suite of Lua plugins which cater to a more traditional roleplaying 
experience, with persistent and realistic characters, jobs, laws, and so-on.

**Realism**

Players should be encouraged, or perhaps required, to adopt a realistic name. 
Not "420 blazeit DoYouNoDeWay 2018", but "Matthew Sharpe". They should be 
expected to play their job role, not run around wildly arresting people for 
any reason they make up. Terrorists shouldn't even exist. Killing someone in 
the street should be a major plot event, not an everyday occurance. 

**Persistent characters**

When a character is granted the rank of Police Officer, they are that Police 
Officer for now, and the next time they connect, and perhaps in a month's time. 
Gone is the concept of voting for who will be a hitman, but rather players 
shall apply for a job in a way desired by the server administrator. 

This will encourage players to maintain a good reputation for not abusing or 
misusing their job role, and establish a higher quality of roleplay and 
experience in certain roles.

**Multiple characters**

A single player can have multiple characters. Perhaps one is a Police Detective, 
and the other is the member of the local mob. This allows for persistent jobs 
without things getting stale for the player. At the same time, it means that 
a player who is usually a police officer doesn't have to act out to get his or 
her kicks, and can create a new character who is a bit quirky or a criminal.

**Extensible** 

SoyuzRP has been designed from the ground-up to be extremely flexible and allow 
for more plugins to be easily integrated into it. It will provide APIs which 
permit for easily detecting a character's job, organisation, and so-on, and 
enable you to do things with this information easily.

## The Team

At time of writing, SoyuzRP is a one-man project, under development by Alastair 
Campbell, also known as 'Chartax'. I don't anticipate others joining the team, 
but who knows what the future holds.

**Alastair Blake 'Chartax' Campbell**

    I am a software developer from Scotland, in the UK. I've been roleplaying 
for over ten years, starting in Neverwinter Nights but mostly playing the 
Specialists Roleplay. I have been a big fan of Garry's Mod since version 6, 
back in around 2005 or so. I created this project because I was disappointed 
by the state of most roleplay servers in Garry's Mod and wanted to change it.

## Contributions

At this time, I am not seeking other individuals to join the development team.

However, I would greatly appreciate your support, advice and friendship if you 
are interested in the project. I can be reached on Steam:

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is this project?**

    SoyuzRP is a suite of Lua plugins for Garry's Mod to enable good, 
high-quality roleplaying servers to reach their full potential without 
needing their own coder or technical skill. The hope is that SoyuzRP will 
encourage server owners to implement a higher quality of roleplay, the likes 
of which are not often seen in Garry's Mod.

**What do you mean by *higher quality* of roleplay?**

    Most servers which claim to be "roleplay" are a far cry away from what 
things used to be like in the height of The Specialists Roleplaying. It seems 
that the definition of roleplay has been redefined into maximizing the amount 
of cash, guns and property owned. Killing others in the street for no real 
reason is allowed and sometimes encouraged. Concepts like using /advert to 
announce that you have accepted a hit are encouraged, and commonplace.

**How will a plugin suite encourage better roleplay?**

    SoyuzRP is written with the intention that jobs are a little more permenent 
than they are in, say, DarkRP. People don't hold a vote to become a police 
officer, or a criminal, and so on. Each individual who wishes to hold an 
important position within the city has to go through an applications process, 
determined by the server's management team, before being recruited to an 
organization. They then have access to that job, for as long as they are on 
the server. Assuming they don't get fired for abusing their position, that is.

**Why *Soyuz* RP?**

    SoyuzRP is inspired by those that came before it, such as HWRP, but most 
notably, ApolloRP which was written by the extremely talented Hawk552. SoyuzRP 
would do very well to emulate ApolloRP, and it is the best we can hope for.
